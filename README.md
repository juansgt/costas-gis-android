# costas-gis-android
Mobile client application of the geographic information system responsible for managing the public business licenses throughout the coast of Spain. Its implementation is written in Java using the Android SDK.
<p></p>
The application includes the AsyncExtensions module (library), It provides an easy mechanism to make asynchronous method callbacks, hiding the complexity of using threads, asynctask and similar constructions to developers building the presentation layer.
<p></p>
Some of the most representative features the application provides are:
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Show the geometry of the licenses on top of a Google Maps viewer using markers.
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Show a small description of the license through a pop-up on top of the map. See the detailed information in a new screen.<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Street view and Google Navigator interaction.<p></p>
This application is part of my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering final project. There are two other applications (back-end and Web client) completing the project:
